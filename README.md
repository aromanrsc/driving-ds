# Driving Dataset

This driving dataset is used and described in the following paper: [Evaluating the Privacy and Utility of Time-Series Data Perturbation Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/11/5/1260).

Data was collected via the OBD-II port on a VW Passat auto vehicle using the OBD Fusion mobile app. Data were recorded every 1 second during driving, and 134 features were extracted. Regular behavior (rx) and sensitive behavior (sx) were collected on the same route in similar traffic conditions.
